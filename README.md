# SolarInvicta
This is a test version may cause some unknown crash, only English and Simplified Chinese supported

Enable you to use drop pods to deploy army from orbit, establish nations on other spacebodies with some special investment buffs and develop Antarctica and build habs on Earth!
现在可以用飞船空投陆军，在其它星球建国(投资规则和地球略有不同)，开发南极同时在地球上建基地了

No need to replace localization now, please delete the old one you use
Please replace the regionoutlines in Terra Invicta\TerraInvicta_Data\StreamingAssets\AssetBundles
把原来添加的汉化删了，需要替换一个资产文件，具体看上面

To get the buff of space nations you need to install unity mod manager version 0.25.0 or later version from Nexus Mods (https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21)
体验完整内容需要在 https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21 下载安装Unity mod manager 0.25.0及以后的版本

Install Unity Mod Manager using Doorstop Proxy installation method.

I would strongly recommed to make a copy from Steam\steamapps\common before using this mod

Solar Invicta aims to provide some interesting content for your boring lategame. Some features were already tested in earlier version of the game but it needs some time to re-code it in Harmony to make it available on steam workshop. Some test version will be released on steam workshop.

Features already tested in earlier version:

Colonization and found Nations on other planets and moons:
-Some habs will become regions with unlimited potential for development when some Projects about colonization was finished. 
-You could spend a some Money or Boosts to send a group of colonists through an event when first colony on a certain SolarBody was founded.
-In the early stage of the colonization, the knowledge investment will have a huge buff while the economy investment will experience a debuff. 
-The welfare investment will directly bring some people to your colony and this amount will decrease when population is increasing.
-Annual Boosts will depends on the escape velocity of the Solarbody and usually much higher that earth.

SpaceMarines armed with unmanned combat machines to fight against aliens in other planets and assault your enemies on earth from the orbit:
-The SpaceMarines could be built as an utility module "Drop Pods" for spaceships and there are 2 mods to deploy. Fast deploy will destroy the spaceship and spawn the army directly. Slow deploy will spawn army similar to alien armies.
-The miltech level of the SpaceMarines will only depend on global miltech cap which is slightly higher than human armies.
-A special operation IntoOrbit Could move SpaceMarines back to spaceships with empty Drop Pods Module.

New Economy System use Boosts instead of space resources to develop the solar system:
-2 more T3 mining facilities: one will produce Boost directly based on resources while another will produce more rare resources.
-The time and cost to build space facilities will be significant decreased when some Project is complete.
Some other features:
-Module for spaceships and spacestations to intercept ICBMs.
-New regions in Antarctica and on the seabed.
-Stronger Alien Fleets with thicker armor, better engines and more weapons.
-A story line of United Nations of Earth and some Project about it.
Planning features:
-New models and illustrations for SpaceMarines.
-New background, illustrations and textures for terraformed Mars and Venus.
-Events, Projects and Objectives for the features above.
-T4 habs in space with specific functions such as o'neill cylinder, interplanetary laser satellite, giant particle accelerator, skyhook and anything you could imagine.
-New endgame conditions that allows you to sale terraforming technology to Hydra and help them to rebuild their home world.
-Weaponized asteroids for interplanetary strikes
