CTD fixed, enable you to use drop pods to deploy army from orbit, establish nations on other spacebodies with some special investment buffs and develop Antarctica and build habs on Earth!
现在可以用飞船空投陆军，在其它星球建国(投资规则和地球略有不同)，开发南极同时在地球上建基地了

No need to replace localization now, please delete the old one you use
Please replace the regionoutlines in Terra Invicta\TerraInvicta_Data\StreamingAssets\AssetBundles
先把原来添加的汉化删了，需要替换一个资产文件，具体看上面

Solar Invicta aims to provide some interesting content for your boring lategame. Some features were already tested in earlier version of the game but it needs some time to re-code it in Harmony to make it available on steam workshop. Some test version will be released on steam workshop.

Colonization and found Nations on other planets and moons:
-Some habs will become regions with unlimited potential for development when some Projects about colonization was finished. 
-You could spend a some Money or Boosts to send a group of colonists through an event when first colony on a certain SolarBody was founded.
-In the early stage of the colonization, the knowledge investment will have a huge buff while the economy investment will experience a debuff. 
-The welfare investment will directly bring some people to your colony and this amount will decrease when population is increasing.
-Annual Boosts will depends on the escape velocity of the Solarbody and usually much higher that earth.

SpaceMarines armed with unmanned combat machines to fight against aliens in other planets and assault your enemies on earth from the orbit:
-The SpaceMarines could be built as an utility module "Drop Pods" for spaceships and there are 2 mods to deploy. Fast deploy will destroy the spaceship and spawn the army directly. Slow deploy will spawn army similar to alien armies.
-The miltech level of the SpaceMarines will only depend on global miltech cap which is slightly higher than human armies.

In addition, if you are really interested in this project and willing provide some help in 
-Test the mod with lots of bugs
-Harmony coding
-Json editing
-Making illustration and 3D models
-Writing stories
-Do some localization works (Most text is written in English and I can do the localization for simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese)
